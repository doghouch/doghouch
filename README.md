### Introduction :wave:

Hi, there! I am a student @ UofT and currently work at bunny.net as a Junior Software Developer. 

A nonexhaustive list of my hobbies can be found below:

- Programming
  - I currently "main" C# and Python
  - I've *tried* to write a kernel driver, but that didn't go well (having said that, watching the folks over at @AsahiLinux use Rust makes me want to revisit this)
- Drawing 

- Tinkering with hardware
  - I still haven't had the chance to play around with my FPGA dev. board
  - I prefer using RPI Zero boards (given their size) but I've also played around with designing a few PCBs
  
- Managing my overcomplicated home network
  - It works when it works (TM)
  - "don't touch anything"
    
- Anime
  - I enjoy a large variety of anime, but prefer "Slice Of Life" shows
    
- Studying Language
  - I am bilingual and speak both English & French
