### Introduction :wave:

Hi, there! I am a student @ UofT and currently work at bunny.net as a Junior Software Developer. 

A nonexhaustive list of my hobbies can be found below:

- Programming
  - I use C# and Python the most (right now)
  - Things that I am not proud of: I jigged up an IR-blaster device to send commands to my "dumb" air conditioner. The REST API is hooked up to a hodgebodge of sensors and uses an wattmeter to determine state (off/fan/cooling). 

- Drawing 

- Tinkering with hardware
  - ~~I still haven't had the chance to play around with my FPGA developer board. Currently exploring how much bandwidth I can push through the FPGA (as a "dumb" switch)~~
  - I prefer using RPI Zero boards (given their size) but I've also played around with designing a few PCBs that work around the ESP32
  
- Managing my home network
  - It works when it works (TM)
  - Omada SDN makes me sad
  - "don't touch anything"
    
- Anime
  - I enjoy a large variety of anime, but prefer "Slice Of Life" shows
    
- Studying Language
  - I am bilingual and speak both English & French (conversational; I have not actively spoken French in a long time)
